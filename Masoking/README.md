## Short Game Description  


## My Roles in the project

During the project I've designed the puzzles and how they should be structured and with the help off my coworkers to make them feel as good to control as possible.  
I also did all the music and sound effects and created a script to use them in a 3D enviorment.  
I was also in charge of creating how to use the menu and title screen.
And also co created, movement and how to interact with everything.

## Puzzles I've designed

### Consepts

First idea was a block puzzle in which you move blocks on platforms to make things move or open, so the first one is to make the platform move down to get the other block to the other floor, and then use one off the triggers to get another block to push into the other trigger to open the gate on the left side.  

Second idea was a clock puzzle which you controll a standing turner that has a minute and hour trigger that you need to put on the right "time" the time you get by exploring.

## Sound and Music Manager

  ### How it works

  The whole structure is a sound effects manager that works in 3D its set up with Enums and Dictionaries to set up everything.  
  You have control to change size of the object in game, volume, spartial blend and if it should be looping or not.  
  And then just call it wherever you want a sound or sound loop to appear
