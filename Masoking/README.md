## Short Game Description  


## My Roles in the project

During the project I've designed the puzzles and how they should be structured and with the help off my coworkers to make them feel as good to control as possible.  
I also did all the music and sound effects and created a script to use them in a 3D enviorment.  
I was also in charge of creating how to use the menu and title screen.
And also co created, movement and how to interact with everything.

## Game objects I've designed

### Falling Jester

I've designed the green jester that falls when you dash into it. How they work is that they move one way to another and you are supposed to dash into it to make it fall over and then stand in the red line to take damage. It wobles with code and have some animation to seem like its tipping over

### Bomb

The bomb works by having a timer until it sets off and the you need to be near it to take damage, and when you take damage you also launch away by the explosion impact

## Sound and Music Manager

  ### How it works

  The whole structure is a sound effects manager that works in 3D its set up with Enums and Dictionaries to set up everything.  
  You have control to change size of the object in game, volume, spartial blend and if it should be looping or not.  
  And then just call it wherever you want a sound or sound loop to appear
