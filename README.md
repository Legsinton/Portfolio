**About**  
A 3D puzzle/exploration game with horror elements.  
You travel through a temple with a goal to restore the godess who controls the land, but beware the godess has a vengence and is doing everything to stop you.  

**My contribution**  
During the project I've designed the puzzles and how they should be structured.  
I also did all the music and sound effects and created a script to use them in a 3D enviorment.  
I was also in charge of creating how the UI functions.

## [Masoking](Masoking/) &larr; Click for more!

**About**
You play as Masoking, a king who is a huge masocist and is commanding his jester to cause him as much pain as possible for his own plessure.  
The goal is to get hit by all kinds off projectiles in this reverse bullet hell, but beware if he doesnt get satisfied then you lose the game.  

**My contribution**
I helped designing how the character plays, and also some jesters, in how they work.  
Creating music and sound effects and how to use them was a big part off what I did.
I also created the intro stage, how it works and what you where suppsoed to do.
