## [Ruin](Ruin/) &larr; Click for more!

**About**  
A 3D puzzle/exploration game with horror elements.  
You travel through a temple with a goal to restore the godess who controls the land, but beware the godess has a vengence and is doing everything to stop you.  

**My contribution**  
during the project I've designed the puzzles and how they should be structured.  
I also did all the music and sound effects and created a script to use them in a 3D enviorment.
I was also in charge of creating how the UI functions.
