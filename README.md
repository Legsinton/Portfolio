**About**
You play as Masoking, a king who is a huge masocist and is commanding his jester to cause him as much pain as possible for his own plessure.  
The goal is to get hit by all kinds off projectiles in this reverse bullet hell, but beware if he doesnt get satisfied then you lose the game.  

**My contribution**
I helped designing how the character plays, and also some jesters, in how they work.  
Creating music and sound effects and how to use them was a big part off what I did.
I also created the intro stage, how it works and what you where suppsoed to do.
