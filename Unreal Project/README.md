## Short Project Description  

A 3D platformer type of game that uses a grappling hook to reach different platforms and get to the end off the level.
The project was created during our Unreal course and I used the time too learn more about how to create a 3D game with different animations and ways to traverse the world with a grappling hook and using node based coding to do so. 
I created different objects which include, Blocks to grapple to, platforms that moves when you hit it with the grappling hook, moving platforms, spike blocks to take damage, blocks you can push and launch.
Other things include, falling damage, extra animations for the character, run function, crouch and a health system.
